## About
ApertusVR offers a brand new "no vendor lock-in" approach for
virtual and augmented reality on different operating systems
and on different virtual and augmented reality hardware.

This higher abstraction level enables that the business logic
has to be implemented once and then it works on any platform.
Moreover these different virtual and augmented reality hardware
can be shared a same virtual reality scene at the same time.

The ApertusVR engine only contains libraries in order to 
easily integrate the virtual and augmented reality technologies
into an already existing product.
By the help of the factory plugins and samples
ApertusVR could boosts up the creation of a minimum viable product from scratch.
